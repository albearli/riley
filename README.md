In the future where banking reaches migrates into a digital frontier, individual users and businesses will need a personal and customized data analytics platform to guide them.


We believe that the future of work is freelance. The Gig Economy has grown nearly 20% in the past decade: a record 15% of the workforce is completely self-employed. And the rate of growth only accelerates, having doubled since 2017.

But gig workers are in a position ill-served by traditional institutions. Banks especially separate personal from business financial solutions, and freelance workers are left straddling the gap between the two. There are tools for individuals, and there are tools for business. We sought to make a tool for people who are their own business.
